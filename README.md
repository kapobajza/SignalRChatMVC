# SignalRChatMVC
Real-time chat application using ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework and SignalR

This is just a simple chat application. It's just version 1 of it and I haven't implemented all of the functionalities that I planned to. It also needs a lot of improvement.

If you want to use the app, first off change the connection string in the WebUI project > Web.config. Then I would suggest that you use code-first migrations to create the database.
